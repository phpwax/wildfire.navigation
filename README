use:
<?=partial("nav/__navigation", array('root'=>$root));?>

$root is a WildfireNavigationItem (Primary / Footer from example below)

The idea is the top level page is the navigation block (multi-lingual)
  - Primary
    - Home
    - News
    - Contact
  - Footer
    - Sitemap
    
and similar, this way the built in sort function (for content items) will work nicely
